# Understanding-Keras-Layers
This repository is an effort to condense the information about various keras layers and present them in simplest way possible. The inspiration for this effort came from my mentor and after going through few examples on Kaggle. I also tried to follow the examples provided by https://www.youtube.com/@MuratKarakayaAkademi
